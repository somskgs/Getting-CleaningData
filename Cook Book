# This is the code book for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project of Coursera

##What is explained ? 
This code book explains the variables, data, and  transformation steps and data wrangling done to clean up the data.

# About This Data Set 
This data set belongs to the UCI Machine Learning repository.

Explanation as below:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, team captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for
generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width
sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational 
and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The dataset includes the following files which are important for reference:

<li> README.txt </li>

<li> features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector </li>

<li> features.txt: List of all features </li>

<li> activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name</li>

<li> train/X_train.txt': Training set</li>

<li> train/y_train.txt': Training labels </li>

<li> test/X_test.txt': Test set </li>

<li> test/y_test.txt': Test labels </li>

# Data Wrangling & Transformation Steps 

Before you begin the the code ensure you have the UCI HAR Dataset folder in the working directory or the folder where you download the R code.

<b> Part 1,2,3 : </b>

Parts 1 to 3 are performed as follows:

<li> Checking Installation of packages:  We check if the packages of reshape2 and data.table exist or not and we install them accordingly </li>
<li> Getting directory: Next we get directory or current working path of the computer </li>
<li> Test Set: The code reads data from the required files performs transformation in the  test  folders along with reading the activity labels text file, subject file and X set and Y label set, post transformations the dataset is binded</li>
<li> Test Set: Before binding the data set the data in X set is filtered by selecting only the variables explaing the STD and Mean columns  </li>
<li> Train Set: The code reads data from the required files performs transformation in the  train folders along with reading the activity labels text file, subject file and X set and Y label set, post transformations the dataset is binded</li>
<li> Test Set: Before binding the data set the data in X set is filtered by selecting only the variables explaing the STD and Mean columns  </li>
<li> Binding the Tes Set and Train Set: Next the Data Sets of test and train are binded to form one finalset using rowbinding (rbind)</li>
<li> Transformation on final set: We cast and dcast the data to get the mean </li>

# Running Or Setting Up the files

1. Load UCI HAR Dataset directory in the working path 
2. Load the R code into the working directory
3. Execute the R file using R Studio or other ide supporting R.
4. Go through the downloaded tidy data in .csv format.
